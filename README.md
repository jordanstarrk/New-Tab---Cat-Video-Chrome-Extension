# Jstarrk: Be happy when you open a new tab README
This is a simple Chrome extension that generates a moving image everytime you create a New Tab. 

There is 4 mp4's included in this extension, and it randomly cycles through each when you open a new tab. 

This is a native client application and only works in Chrome web browser.

It would be cool to get a larger library of videos and host them on a simple web app, and expose a random mp4 on an endpoint. This extension could then be modified and get it's mp4 from the web app. This would allow the extension to remain small, and have a large variety of mp4's to keep us happy when opening a new tab.

Thank you https://videos.pexels.com, and http://www.wedistill.io/ for the stock videos! 

Send me your videos if you would like them added!
